# QnA Bestie on PDF

The app takes a PDF and allows user to ask questions and provides corresponding answers extracted from PDFs. The AI behind the app is the Llama2 model. While the model is open source and offers free usage, the challenge lies in the computationally expensive setup, therefore in this project replicate API has been used which has a free API quota.
